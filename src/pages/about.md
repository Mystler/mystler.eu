**Hey!**

My name is Florian but I am better known online as Mystler!

I am a geek from Germany who loves all kinds of creativity, be that through programming, music, media, or even writing. I love watching things come to life as I put work into them. My interests are very wide-ranging - too wide ranging to explain everything within the scope of this website - but you will find me sharing a glimpse into my interests and skills here.

This personal website has been developed by myself using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tailwind CSS</a>, and <a href="http://fontawesome.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Font Awesome</a>.

If you need to contact me, you can do so at:<br>
