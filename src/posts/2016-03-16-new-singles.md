title: New Singles
---

Over the last two years, I have held back some music. I intended to release those songs as part of an album. However, since I do not create new stuff as often as I would like to, holding on to songs feels wrong. I really want my music to be out there for everyone to enjoy. This is why I recently uploaded a few songs to my YouTube and SoundCloud accounts. Check out the <a href="/music">Music</a> page or listen to them here. Special thanks to my friend Rico from <a href="http://einhundertstel.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">einhundertstel.eu</a> for creating two cover arts and <a href="http://invertedpixel.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keith "Tweek" Lord</a> for the permission to use his artwork for the _Rise of a Hero_ video.
