My concepts for WoW fan fiction have developed further, over the last month. I have plans for multiple episodes that turn this project into a whole series of short stories. I cannot say when I will manage to release the next ones. Currently, I have a one to two month period per episode in mind. So, stay tuned as there is more to come. Today, I present the second episode.
