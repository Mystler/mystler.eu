title: Using HTTPS
---
From now on, all of my sites are using encrypted connections. Grummle has been running on HTTPS for a while now and, today, Destiny and this homepage followed. It looks like everything went smoothly, but if you encounter any problems or broken old links, feel free to tell me about them.
