title: "Elite Dangerous: End of Powerplay 1.0 Statistics"
description: With the end of the first version of the Powerplay game mode in Elite Dangerous, I took some time to compile statistics.

This is a nerdy video game post. Or, to be more precise, I already made a nerdy video game post elsewhere but thought I should probably share it here too.

After almost 10 years, the Powerplay game mode in Elite Dangerous is about to be reworked and started as 2.0 with new rules and gameplay very soon. Since I have been involved in coordination of part of the community as well as spreadsheets and tools development behind the scenes, I felt it important to compile and share some statistics as the first version of this game mode comes to an end and people transition over to a new era.

The target audience for this is mainly people that are involved in the Elite Dangerous community. However, anyone is free to check out my massive post that goes through a variety of statistics with some explanations and commentary.
