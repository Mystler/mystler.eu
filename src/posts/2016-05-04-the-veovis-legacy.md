Here is one of my latest projects: World of Warcraft Fan Fiction. Yes, I actually wrote a short story. It's been some time since last I wrote anything like that, but suddenly the ideas flooded my mind and I wanted to try whether I can write them down and create an exciting tale. The result is about eight pages long. Check it out and decide for yourself.

Special thanks to Patrick and Patrick for initial feedback and proofreading.
