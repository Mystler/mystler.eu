title: Season One Finale
---

The finale for the first season of my WoW short stories is now available on the <a href="/words">Words</a> page. Make sure to catch up on the previous episodes, if your interest is sparked. As to my plans for the future, I have the rough story for the next season drafted out and want to tell it sometime (without any ETA). After season two, however, I will likely end this experiment and focus on other projects instead. I started this project because I wanted to try and tell a story, but I do not really consider myself an author.
