title: Madeira 2015 Photos
---

At the moment, I am adding more and more photos from this year's 14 days on Madeira to a Flickr album. I am curious to test that well-known photo platform and, so far, it looks quite nice. You can view the pictures I already posted below. Expect the album to grow over the next weeks.

**Update November 1st:** The album is now complete. Out of almost 600 photos I took on Madeira 163 made it into my Flickr album.
