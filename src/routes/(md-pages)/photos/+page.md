# Photos

From time to time, mostly during vacations, I also indulge in photography. You can find some of the photos I took
here.

By the way, let me also recommend the website <a href="https://einhundertstel.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">einhundertstel.eu</a> of a friend of mine, who really takes a lot of amazing photos that are way better than what I can show you.
